# merkle
 PoC implementation - merkle tree based digital evidence management
 
 Merkle trees make extensive use of one way hashing.
Merkle proofs are established by hashing a hashâ€™s corresponding hash together and climbing up the tree until you obtain the root hash which is or can be publicly known.
Given that one way hashes are intended to be collision free and deterministic algorithms, no two plaintext hashes can/should be the same.

 This idea is adapted to the logical evidence. Logical evidence is used to prove an idea using logic. Deductive reasoning may be used to come to a conclusion to provide logical evidence.
