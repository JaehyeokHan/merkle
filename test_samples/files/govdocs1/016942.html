Kammer, Director</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class="mainText"> <span class="sText"> 			<a name="intro"> 			</a>Introduction</span> 			<br>The International System of Units, universally abbreviated SI (from the French <i>Le Syst&egrave;me International d'Unit&eacute;s</i>),is the modern metric system of measurement. Long the dominant system of measurement used in science, the SI is rapidly becoming the dominant system used in international commerce.</p> <p class="mainText">The first edition of this National Institute of Standards and Technology Publication, NIST SP 814, was published in 1991 and replaced Letter Circular LC 1132 published in 1982 by NIST's predecessor, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). It reprinted the Department of Commerce, NIST, Federal Register notice of December20, 1990 entitled "Metric System of Measurement: Interpretation of the International System of Units for the United States";the Department of Commerce, Office of the Secretary, Federal Register notice of January 2, 1991 entitle "Metric Conversion Policy for Federal agencies"; and Executive Order I2770 issued by the President of the Untied States on July 25, 1991 entitled "Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs."</p> <p class="mainText">The first Federal Register notice restated the interpretation by the Department of Commerce of the International System of Units for the use in the United States that was last published by the Department in 1982; the second revised the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to remove the voluntary aspect of the conversion of the metric system of measurement for Federal agencies; and the Executive Order provided Presidential authority and direction for the use of the metric system of measurement by Federal departments and agencies in their programs. The 1991 edition of the NIST SP814 also included a diagram with accompanying text that showed graphically how the SI derived units with special names and symbols were related to the seven SI base units.</p> <p class="mainText">Since the publication of NIST SP 814 in 1991,the international bodies that are responsible for the SI made some changes to it. It therefore became necessary to set forth a new interpretation of the SI for the United States that reflected those changes. This was done in a Department of Commerce, NIST, Federal Register notice of July 28, 1998, also entitled "Metric System of Measurement: Interpretation of the International System of Units for the Untied States." Further, the changes made to the SI by the responsible international bodies altered the number of SI units with special names and symbols. It is therefore deemed appropriate to publish this 1998 edition of SP 814 with the new Federal Register notice of July 28, 1998 in place of the old notice of December 20,1990, and a revised diagram and accompanying text showing how the SI derived units with special names and symbols are related to the seven SI base units. Further, to make the 1998 edition of NIST SP814 more complete, the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended&nbsp; in 1998, 1995, and 1996, is included. To reflect this additional information on U.S. Government metric policy, the title of this Special Publication has been changed from <i>Interpretation of theSI for the United States and Metric Conversion Policy for Federal Agencies to Interpretation of the SI for the United States and FederalGovernment Metric Conversion Policy.</i> </p> <p class="mainText">Because of the importance of the SI to science,technology, and commerce, and because (i) NIST coordinates the Federal Government policy on the conversion to the SI by Federal agencies and on the use of the SI by U.S. industry, (ii) NIST provides official U.S. representation in the various international bodies established by the Meter Convention that are now responsible for the SI, and(iii) the Secretary of Commerce has delegated his authority to interpretor modify the SI for use in the United States to the NIST Director, NIST provides for those who use the International System many other sources of information on the SI in addition to NIST SP 814. These include NIST SP 811, <i>Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)</i>, by Barry N. Taylor; and NIST SP 330, <i>The International System of Units (SI), </i>Barry N. Taylor, Editor. This latter document is the United States version of the English translation of the definitive international reference on the SI published in French by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM, <i>Bureau International des Poids et Mesures)</i>.</p> <p class="mainText">NIST SP 811, NIST SP 330, the July 28, 1998 Federal Register notice, the "essentials" of the SI together with useful background information, and links to the Web sites of other organizations involved with the SI (for example, the NIST Metric Program and the BIPM itself), are all available on the Web site entitled "NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty"at URL 			<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu">http://physics.nist.gov/cuu			</a>.Users of this NIST publication are encouraged to take advantage of these other sources of information on the SI.			<a name="chart"> 			</a> </p> <p class="mainText" align="right"> 			<a href="#top"> 			<img src="/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/images/up.gif" alt="Return to top of page" align="right" border="0" height="18" width="20"> 			</a> 			<br> 			<a href="#top" target="_top"> 			<font size="-2">Return to top of Page			</font> 			</a> 			<br> </p> <p class="mainText" align="center"> 			<img src="/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/images/SI_Diagram_Color_April_2008.jpg" alt="SI Diagram Color April 2008" align="absmiddle" border="0" height="618" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="784"> </p>  <p class="mainText"> Click 			<a class="CP___PAGEID_17274" href="/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/SI_Diagram_Color_April_2008-2.pdf">here</a> to view a PDF version of the diagram 			<img src="/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/images/pdf.gif" alt="" border="0" height="15" width="15">.<br>(This diagram replaces the previously published diagram in <span style="font-weight: bold;">SP 814: Interpretation of the SI for the United States and the Federal Government Metric Conversion Policy</span>) May, 2008<br></p> <p class="mainText" align="right"> 			<a href="#top" target="_top"> 			<font size="-2">Return to top of page			</font> 			</a> 			<a href="#top"> 			<img src="/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/images/up.gif" alt="Return to top of Page" border="0" height="15" width="20"> 			</a> </p> <p> <span class="sText">Relationships of the SI Derived Units with Special Names and the SI Base Units			<br> </span>The diagram above shows graphically how the 21 SI derived units with special names and symbols are related to the seven SI base units. In the first column, the symbols of the SI base units are shown in rectangles, with the name of the unit shown toward the upper left of the rectangle and the name of the associated base quantity shown in italic type below the rectangle. In the third column the symbols of the SI derived units with special names and symbols are shown in solid circles, with the name of the unit shown toward the upper left of the circle, the name of the associated derived quantity shown in italics type below the circle, and an expression of the derived unit in terms of other units shown toward the upper right in parentheses. In the second column are shown thosederived units without special names and symbols that are used inthe derivation of the derived units with special names and symbols[the cubic meter m<sup>3</sup> excepted]. In the diagram, the derivation of each derived unit is indicated by arrows that bring in units in the numerator (solid lines) and units in the denominator (broken lines), as appropriate.</p> <p class="mainText">Two SI derived units with special names and symbols, the radian, symbol rad, and the steradian, symbol sr (bottom of the third column of the diagram), are shown without any connection to SI base units—either direct or through other SI derived units. The reason is that in the SI, the quantities plane angle and solid angle are defined in such a way that their dimension is one—they are so-called dimensionless quantities. This means that the coherent SI derived unit for each of these quantities is the number one, symbol 1. That is, because plane angle is expressed as the ratio of two lengths, and solid angle as the ratio of an area and the square of a length, the SI derived unit for the plane&nbsp; angle is m/m=1, and the SI derived unit for solid angle is m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>=1.To aid understanding, the special name radian with symbol rad is given to the number 1 for use in expressing values of solid angle.However, one has the option of using or not using these names and symbols in expressions for other SI derived units, as is convenient.</p> <p class="mainText">The unit "degree Celsius," which is equal in magnitude to the unit "kelvin," is used to express Celsius temperature <i>t</i>. In this case, "degree Celsius"is a special name used in place of "kelvin." This equalityis indicated in the diagram by the symbol K in parenthesis toward the upper right of the &ordm;C circle. The equation below CELSIUS TEMPERATURE relates Celsius temperature <em>t </em>to thermodynamic temperature <em>T</em>. An interval or difference of Celsius temperature can, however, be expressed in kelvins as well as in degrees Celsius.</p> <p class="mainText" align="right"> 			<a href="#top" target="_top"> 			</a> 			<a href="#top"> 			</a> 			<a href="#top" target="_top"> 			<font size="-2">Return to top of page			</font> 			</a> 			<a href="#top"> 			<img src="/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/images/up.gif" alt="Return to top of Page" border="0" height="15" width="20"> 			</a> </p> <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p class="mainText"> <i> 			<img src="/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/images/pdf.gif" alt="" border="0" height="15" width="15">To view documents which are pdf files, 			<a href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.adobe.com/Acrobat/readstep.html">Adobe Acrobat's Reader			</a> is required.

This interpretation was last published by the Department of Commerce in the Federal Register on December 20, 1990 (55 FR52242-52245). Since the publication of that notice, the international bodies that are responsible for the SI have made some changes to it.

Metric system authorized. - </b>It shall be lawful throughout the United States of America to employ&nbsp; the weights and measures of the metric system; and no contract or dealing, or pleading in any court, shall be deemed invalid or liable to objection because the weights or measures expressed or referred to therein are weights or measures of the metric system. (14 Stat.339, Adopted July 28,1866)</p> <p> <b>&sect; 205a. Congressional statement of findings. - </b>The Congress finds as follows: </p> <p> </p><blockquote>(1) The United States was an original signatory party to the 1875 Treaty of the Meter (20 Stat. 709), which established the General Conference of Weights and Measures, the International Committee of Weights and Measures and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.</blockquote> <blockquote>(2) Although the use of metric measurement standards in the United States has been authorized by law since 1866 this Nation today is the only industrially developed nation which has not established a national policy of committing itself and taking steps to facilitate conversion to the metric system. </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> (3) World trade is increasingly geared towards the metric system of measurement. </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> (4) Industry in the United States is often at a competitive disadvantage when dealing in international markets because of its nonstandard measurement system, and is sometimes excluded when it is unable to deliver goods which are measured in metric terms. </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> (5) The inherent simplicity of the metric system of measurement and standardization of weights and measures has led to major cost savings in certain industries which have converted to that system. </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> (6) The Federal Government has a responsibility to develop procedures and techniques to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement. </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> (7) The metric system of measurement can provide substantial advantages to the Federal Government in its own operations.</blockquote> <p> <b>&sect; 205b. Declaration of policy. -</b> It is therefore the declared policy of the United States-</p> <p> </p><blockquote> (1) to designate the metric system of measurement as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce; </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> (2) to require that each Federal agency			<font size="-2"> <sup> 			<a href="#footnote2">2			</a> </sup> 			</font>,by a date certain and to the extent economically feasible by the end of the fiscal year 1992, use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other business-related activities,except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units; </blockquote>			 <p> </p><blockquote> (3) to seek out ways to increase understanding of the metric system of measurement through educational information and guidance and in Government publications; and </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> (4) to permit the continued use of traditional systems of weights and measures in non-business activities.</blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <b>&sect; 205c.

Federal agenciesare also now required to use the metric system in procurement, grantsand other businessrelated activities. by a date certain and to theextent economically feasible by the end of fiscal year 1992, exceptto the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to causesignificant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms,such as when foreign competitors are producing competing productsin nonmetric units.</p> <p class="mainText"> These declarations and the accompanying reportof the Congressional conferees require this updating of the existingFederal policy document. The policy set out below was issued asa proposed rule: "Metric Conversion Policy for Federal Agencies,"54 FR 41848, October 12, 1989. which updated the policy stated ina prior notice: "Metric Conversion Policy for Federal Agencies,"50 FR 27577, July 5. 1985. The updated policy has been taken directlyfrom the 1985 notice. However, this rule amends the earlier policyto bring the references an text up-to-date. The policy clarifiesand strengthens Federal program requirements. Implementing agencyinitiatives are expected.</p> <p class="mainText"> The current text reflects comments received fromthe public (i comment) as well as from the Federal Metrication OperatingCommittee (MOC.) The text of the policy has been approved by theFederal Interagency Council on Metric Policy (ICMP.) Recommendedchanges from the representatives of the ICMP/ MOC included updatingthe <strong>Federal Register</strong> notice defining the "metricsystem," clarifying the term "other business-related activities,"and adding agency reporting requirements. These changes were madeand are incorporated in the rule.</p> <p class="mainText"> The only private sector response was from theAmerican Petroleum Institute (API.) The API commented on: (1) Section19.23(a), encouraging DoC to continue to coordinate federal agencymetrication activities. That section was modified in the final,although it never mentioned DoC. However 19.22(a) refers to theDepartment's coordination role; (2) section 19.23(b). asking fora clarification of "areas where metrication is dependent onagency initiatives." That language was clarified and became19.23(c);and (3) section 19.23(d) pointing out that the AmericanNational Metric Council and the U.S. Metric Association are goodsources for agencies seeking information on private sector metricationefforts. Section 19.24(d) recommends that agencies " maintainliaison with private sector groups (such as the American NationalMetric Council and the U.S. Metric Association) that are involvedin planning for or coordinating National transition to the metricsystem."</p> <p class="mainText"> <span class="sText">Rulemaking Requirement</span> 			<br>Under Executive Order 12291 the Department must judge whether aregulation is major within the meaning of section 1 of the Orderand, therefore, subject to the requirement that a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis be prepared.
